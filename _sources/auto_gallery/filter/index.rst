    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="Wavelet Analysis is a mathematical tool that decomposes signals or data into different frequency components, allowing localized analysis in both time and frequency domains. Unlike Fourier analysis, which provides only global frequency information, wavelets use scalable and shiftable basis functions (&quot;wavelets&quot;) to capture transient features, trends, and discontinuities at multiple resolutions.">

It extends traditional Fourier analysis by applying a two-dimensional (2D) spectral decomposition to isolate and characterize different wave modes (e.g., Kelvin waves, Rossby waves, and mixed Rossby-gravity waves) based on their dispersion relations.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="Barnes filter is a commonly used spatial filtering method that mainly uses two constants g and c to calculate Gaussian weights, and performs spatial interpolation for each grid point, thus becoming a low-pass filter that filters out high-frequency fluctuations. When using two different schemes of constant g and c schemes, both retain low-frequency fluctuations of different scales. The difference between the filtering results of the two methods can result in mesoscale fluctuations.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) is an adaptive time-space analysis method suitable for processing series that are non-stationary and non-linear. EMD performs operations that partition a series into &#x27;modes&#x27; (IMFs; Intrinsic Mode Functions) without leaving the time domain. It can be compared to other time-space analysis methods like Fourier Transforms and wavelet decomposition. Like these methods, EMD is not based on physics. However, the modes may provide insight into various signals contained within the data. In particular, the method is useful for analyzing natural signals, which are most often non-linear and non-stationary. Some common examples would include the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), Niño 3.4 Index, etc.">

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="The KF filter is a specialized spectral analysis technique designed to isolate and study tropical atmospheric waves by decomposing meteorological fields into their wavenumber-frequency components. Unlike traditional Fourier methods, the W-K filter applies a symmetric/antisymmetric separation to distinguish between different wave types, such as Kelvin waves, Rossby waves, and mixed Rossby-gravity waves, based on their theoretical dispersion relations. This approach is particularly effective in identifying convectively coupled waves, where tropical rainfall and large-scale circulation interact. In meteorology, the W-K filter is widely used to analyze Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) dynamics, monsoon variability, and other tropical wave disturbances, providing insights into their propagation characteristics and impacts on weather systems.">
