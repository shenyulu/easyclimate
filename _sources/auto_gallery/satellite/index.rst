    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip="Meteorological satellites can uniformly observe the distribution of clouds, water vapor, sea ice, etc. over a wide area, including oceans, deserts, and mountainous regions, where meteorological observations are difficult, and are extremely useful for monitoring the weather and climate of the entire planet, including the atmosphere, oceans, snow and ice. They are also a very effective means of observation for monitoring typhoons over the ocean. They also play a role in relaying meteorological data, tide data, seismic intensity data, etc. observed on ships and remote islands.">
