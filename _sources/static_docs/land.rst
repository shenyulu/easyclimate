Land-atmosphere processes involve the complex interactions and feedbacks between the terrestrial
surface and the overlying atmosphere, playing a pivotal role in Earth's climate system. These
interactions regulate the exchange of energy, water, carbon, and momentum, influencing weather
patterns, climate variability, and long-term climate change.

Key components include surface energy balance, evapotranspiration, soil moisture dynamics,
and vegetation-atmosphere coupling. For example, soil moisture affects near-surface temperature
and humidity, modulating heatwaves and precipitation. Vegetation influences albedo, transpiration,
and carbon sequestration, linking ecosystems to atmospheric processes.

Land-atmosphere processes are sensitive to human activities, such as deforestation, urbanization,
and agriculture, which alter surface properties and feedback mechanisms. These processes
are also modulated by climate variability, including droughts and heatwaves, creating bidirectional impacts.

Understanding land-atmosphere interactions is essential for improving climate models,
particularly in simulating boundary-layer dynamics and regional climate changes. Advanced
observational networks, remote sensing, and Earth system models are key tools for exploring
these intricate processes and their implications.
