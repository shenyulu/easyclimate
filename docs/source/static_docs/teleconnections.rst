Teleconnection processes in climatology refer to large-scale, persistent patterns of
atmospheric variability that connect climate anomalies across distant regions.
These patterns arise from wave dynamics, such as Rossby waves, and are critical
for understanding climate variability and extreme weather events.

Key examples include the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern, the North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO), and the East Atlantic (EA) pattern. The PNA links the tropical
Pacific with North American weather, influencing temperature and precipitation.
The NAO, characterized by pressure differences between the Azores High and the
Icelandic Low, modulates European winters and Atlantic storm tracks. The EA pattern,
closely related to the NAO, affects the Mediterranean and North Atlantic regions.

Teleconnections interact with other climate modes, such as ENSO,
amplifying or dampening their impacts. They influence energy transport,
jet stream positions, and storm paths, with substantial socio-economic implications.
Accurate simulation of these processes in climate models is crucial for seasonal
forecasting and understanding climate system dynamics.
