Ocean-atmosphere interactions, or coupled processes, involve the dynamic exchange of heat,
moisture, and momentum between the ocean and atmosphere, fundamentally driving climate
variability and long-term climate patterns.

Tropical systems like the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)
are prime examples. ENSO alternates between El Niño (warm phase) and La Niña (cool phase),
significantly affecting global weather, precipitation patterns, and ocean circulation.
The IOD, driven by sea surface temperature gradients in the Indian Ocean, modulates
monsoons and regional climate extremes.

In mid-latitudes, phenomena like the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) influence climate on
interdecadal timescales. The PDO’s warm and cool phases impact marine ecosystems, North
American weather, and global climate variability.

These interactions operate through feedback mechanisms, such as the Bjerknes feedback in
ENSO, amplifying initial anomalies. Understanding ocean-atmosphere coupling is critical
for climate prediction, requiring integrated observational networks and coupled climate
models to capture these complex, multiscale processes.
