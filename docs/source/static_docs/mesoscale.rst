Typhoons are intense tropical cyclones that form over warm ocean waters in the Northwest Pacific.
They develop from low-pressure systems, fueled by heat and moisture from the sea,
and bring heavy rain, strong winds, and storm surges.

In the climate system, typhoons play a key role in redistributing heat and energy.
By transferring warm, moist air from the tropics to higher latitudes,
they help regulate Earth's temperature. They also contribute to ocean mixing,
which affects marine ecosystems and nutrient cycles. However,
climate change may intensify typhoons, increasing their destructive potential. Overall,
typhoons are a natural part of Earth's climate, balancing energy while posing significant risks to coastal regions.
