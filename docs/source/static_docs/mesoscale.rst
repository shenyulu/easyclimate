Mesoscale processes in climatology refer to atmospheric phenomena with spatial scales ranging from a few
kilometers to hundreds of kilometers and temporal scales of hours to a few days. These processes
bridge the gap between synoptic-scale systems, such as mid-latitude cyclones, and microscale
phenomena like turbulence. Key examples include tropical cyclones (typhoons or hurricanes),
mesoscale convective systems, and mountain-induced weather events.

Tropical cyclones, driven by warm oceanic surfaces, feature spiraling winds, intense convection,
and a characteristic eye structure, significantly influencing regional weather and ocean-atmosphere
energy exchanges. Mesoscale convective systems consist of organized thunderstorms producing heavy
rainfall, gusts, and lightning. These processes are critical for water cycles, energy transfer,
and extreme weather forecasting. Advanced numerical models and remote sensing techniques are
crucial for understanding and predicting mesoscale dynamics, as they involve intricate
interactions among atmospheric thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and surface properties.
