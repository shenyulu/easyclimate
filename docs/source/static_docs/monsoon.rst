Monsoons are large-scale seasonal wind and precipitation systems driven by differential
heating between land and ocean. Key examples include the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM)
and the Indian Monsoon, both critical for regional climates and economies.

The EASM is characterized by a northwestward migration of the monsoon rain belt,
shaped by the interaction of the subtropical high, mid-latitude westerlies,
and tropical systems. It delivers substantial rainfall to East Asia, influencing agriculture and water resources.

The Indian Monsoon is driven by strong thermal contrasts between the Indian
Ocean and the South Asian landmass, featuring a distinct summer wet season
with intense rainfall and a dry winter season. The low-level jet over the
Arabian Sea and the monsoon trough play pivotal roles.

Both systems exhibit interannual variability influenced by global phenomena
like ENSO, the Indian Ocean Dipole, and local factors such as land-atmosphere
feedbacks. Accurate prediction of monsoons remains vital due to their socio-economic
impacts and sensitivity to climate change.
