.. Easy Climate
.. =======================================

.. .. image:: _static/easyclimate-logo.svg

.. Easy Climate is a Python library for processing spatial data (bathymetry, geophysics surveys, etc)
.. and interpolating it on regular grids (i.e., gridding).

.. Our core interpolation methods are inspired by machine-learning.
.. As such, Verde implements an interface that is similar to the popular scikit-learn library.
.. We also provide other analysis methods that are often used in combination with gridding,
.. like trend removal, blocked/windowed operations, cross-validation, and more!
