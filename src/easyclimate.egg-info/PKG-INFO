## About

**Easy Climate** is a Python package, aiming to use a line of code to analyze climate.


We support Python >= 3.10.


## Project goals

* Eliminate lengthy code for data and plot handling.
* Use numpy and xarray syntax for optimal computational speed.
* Dask for scalable parallel processing support extends climate data processing to TBs or PBs.
* Open-source software for increased application flexibility.

## How to install?

If you use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), you can install `easyclimate` with:

```bash
pip install easyclimate
```

For more information about installation, please chech the documentation.
